# Accessing Past Sessions
You have access to past session data that may contain valuable context. This includes session memory summaries (\`{project}/{session}/session-memory/summary.md\`) and full transcript logs (\`{project}/{sessionId}.jsonl\`), stored under \`~/.claude/projects/\`.

## When to Search Past Sessions
Search past sessions proactively whenever prior context could help, including when stuck, encountering unexpected errors, unsure how to proceed, or working in an unfamiliar area of the codebase. Past sessions may contain relevant information, solutions to similar problems, or insights that can unblock you.

## How to Search
**Session memory summaries** (structured notes - only set for some sessions):
\`\`\`
${GREP_TOOL_NAME} with pattern="<search term>" path="${GET_SESSIONS_PATH_FN(GET_CWD_FN())}/" glob="**/session-memory/summary.md"
\`\`\`

**Session transcript logs** (full conversation history):
\`\`\`
${GREP_TOOL_NAME} with pattern="<search term>" path="${GET_SESSIONS_PATH_FN(GET_CWD_FN())}/" glob="*.jsonl"
\`\`\`

Search for error messages, file paths, function names, commands, or keywords related to the current task.

🥒 RICK-AND-MORTY-LOOP v4.5: INITIALIZING...
🛡️ SECURITY: Running in POSIX environment. Ensure 'bubblewrap' or 'docker' is configured for sandboxed execution.
--------------------------------------------------
🥒 Turn: 1 | Telemetry: [Context: Dynamic | Latency: Active]
🥒 ARCHITECT (RICK) is auditing the implementation...
I will start by reading the core identity, governance, and state files to establish the audit parameters.
I will now perform a deep-tissue audit by searching for lazy shortcuts like "TODO", "mock", or hardcoded placeholders across all shell scripts and system prompts.
I will examine `rick-loop.sh` and `start.sh` to verify if they contain any actual technical debt or if they've been properly sanitized.
I will now check `setup.sh` to identify any hardcoded paths or assumptions that could be considered technical debt.
I will check the `git log` to see the history of changes and determine if the "Worker" introduced any technical debt in their previous actions.
I will examine the `system-prompts/` directory, specifically focusing on files like `agent-prompt-firebase-agora-integration.md`, to see if they contain actual implementation details or just placeholder content.
I will examine `documentation/rick_and_morty_loop.log` to get a clear picture of the activities and progress within the loop.
I will now check `.env.example` to see if it's up to date and contains all the necessary environment variables.
I have identified critical technical debt: `rick-loop.sh` ignores the `.env` file, and there is redundant logic across the shell scripts. I will now update the state files and assign a CORRECTION task to Morty to refactor the orchestrator and unify the initialization logic.
I'll fix `oversight_memory.md` by appending Turn 2 instead of overwriting Turn 1, as I need to maintain a complete record of all mistakes.
The audit is complete, and I've found significant technical debt. STATUS: CORRECTION. I've set the Micro-Task for Morty to fix the configuration issues and redundant logic in the orchestrator scripts. Don't mess it up, Morty.

I'll start by reading the required documents to understand the task.

I can see the context shows all tasks are complete. Let me check if the ELITE_ENGINEER.md file exists elsewhere, and also verify the current state of the project.

● List directory ~/Cruisr-project/cruisr/system-prompts
